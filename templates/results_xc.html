            The starting point of the project are high resolution X-ray structures of
            enzymes and their complexes with their ligands (inhibitors). This includes
            oligomeric enzymes that are already available in the home laboratory and for
            which the crystallization protocols are well established: hexameric PNPs from
            E. coli and H. pylori, trimeric PNPs from calf spleen, and dimeric
            adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS) from H. pylori. The overall scheme of the
            methodology of the project is given on the figure bellow.

            <h3> Design and implementation of relational database </h3>
            <p>
    
                However, in addition to the structures determined in the home laboratory, all
                known 3D structures of related oligomeric enzymes deposited in the PDB are
                going to serve as an input for creating the central part of the project: a
                comprehensive relational database of all the residues in all the related
                structures, containing a multitude of parameters that describe each residue and
                its environment. The key point is that in this approach no a priori importance
                is attributed to any residues, treating them all as potentially significant for
                specific functionality of the enzyme, such as transmitting allosteric
                communication. Not only will each residue be related to its immediate
                environment (close contacts, hydrogen bonds, disulphide bridges...), but
                through these relations to other related enzymes, the environments themselves
                will be related. Translating purely structural data available from the PDB into
                such highly interconnected multidimensional representation of annotated
                residues will yield immensely rich data structure, and the form of relational
                database will provide extensive querying capabilities. In this way, a search
                for not only primary sequence conservation, which is in essence one
                dimensional, but for truly three dimensional and functional conservation which
                underlies the similarity of the group of enzymes will become possible. The
                database itself will be implemented as a PostgreSQL database as the most
                feature rich, reliable open source database system, capable of containing vast
                amounts of data. It will be filled with data derived from the PDB by automated
                scripts written in Python programming language, which already contains a number
                of ready libraries for handling PDB structures. The database schema and the
                design of tables and relationships within it, will depend on the set of
                features and parameters that will be selected to describe each residue, and
                this will in turn require some initial experimenting with possible choices.
                Another great advantage of relational database model is that only the most
                immediate residue environment (i.e. nearest neighbours shell) has to be taken
                into account and the arbitrary number of next level shells is automatically
                included by the propagation of relationships which is built into the database
                structure. This will allow very fast and cheap examination of distant
                relationships which are thought to take place in allosteric communications.  As
                a parallel development in the project, the whole database will be placed behind
                the web application server with strong visualization capabilities. This will
                serve multiple purposes: representation of enzymesâ€™ 3D structures with easy
                visualization of their properties and relationships to other enzymes; as a
                window for human exploration of the communication pathways discovered by ML
                methods; for searching the database manually for any property or residue; for
                plotting and exploration of any correlations. This will be implementing using
                Django web application framework and D3.js plotting library. As one of the
                results of the project it is planned that this web server be fully operational
                and publicly available.
