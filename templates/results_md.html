                <p> In order to capture the dynamic nature of enzymes, the static
                data derived from the X-ray structures will be complemented by the data derived
                from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the signatures of
                communication pathways. MD simulations will be conducted on several
                representative structures from PNPs (hexameric and trimeric) and AdSS
                (dimeric). The MD trajectories will be analysed by GSATools package [22] to
                find possible allosteric hot-spots and communication pathways. MD simulations
                will provide dynamic information on the residues that play a key role in
                transferring information from one part of the enzyme to the other. MD
                trajectories will be analysed in search of the correlations in residue
                parameters during the MD trajectories, thus revealing otherwise undetectable
                communication channels. This information will be compared with the information
                previously present in the database of related enzymes. It is expected that
                strong correlations should exist in static (X-ray) and dynamic (MD) data in the
                database, confirming the importance of certain regions and in the enzymes.
                Special attention in formulation of residue parameters that are going to be
                used will be paid to differentiation between intra-monomer vs. inter-monomer
                interfaces, as they are undoubtedly playing quite different roles in oligomeric
                enzymes. Oligomeric enzymes in the vast majority of cases possess internal
                symmetry, yet this symmetry is almost always only approximate in the crystal
                structures. It is still unclear whether this is a result of crystal packing
                interactions, or does it have some more fundamental significance. Recent
                findings on some enzymes suggest that this asymmetry is indeed far from
                accidental [48,49]. Having the residues in a relational database will make
                possible the comparison of symmetry between all residue local environments and
                fast identification of those parts that violate the symmetry. Whether this is
                due to crystal packing influence, or if this is a genuine feature of certain
                residues, will be immediately apparent as all the information is contained in
                the database. Furthermore, the connection between this symmetry violations and
                MD derived data will also be available at the same time, supporting the
                importance of certain movements and conformational changes. All this will yield
                new information on mechanism that underpins the information transfer between
                the monomers in this particular class of oligomeric enzymes. Along the way new
                programmatic methods will be established that will possibly be applicable to
                other oligomeric proteins as well.  </p>
